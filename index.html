    <section id="about">
        <h2 class="info">About Me</h2>        
            <p>Born and Raised in Southwest Michigan. Upon graduating from Hartford High School in 2007, I attended Lake Michigan College for a year, prior to enlisting in the United States Army, and learning the skills to become an Air Traffic Controller.  After six years, One Tour to Iraq, and Two Tours to Afghanistan, it was time to move on from that chapter in my life. 
            <p>After getting out of the Army, I became employed at a local Credit Union as a part time Teller. Shortly after that, I moved into a full time roll and never looked back. I have held seven different positions at two different credit unions over the last seven years.</p>
            <p>I recently started a Full Stack Web Development through Michigan State University, in hopes of obtaining a new set of skills to change my career once again. I donâ€™t know what the future holds, but I am excited for the journey ahead. 
                </p>
